This package contains a new hibernate script, designed for Software Suspend 2.

PREREQUISITES
-------------
You will require a kernel patched with Software Suspend 2 to use this script.
Patches are available from http://softwaresuspend.berlios.de/

INSTALLATION
------------
To install, simply run the install.sh script as root:

# ./install.sh
[...]

By default, this will install the following files and directories:

/usr/local/sbin/hibernate        <--- main executable script
/etc/hibernate/
/etc/hibernate/hibernate.conf    <--- main configuration file
/usr/local/share/hibernate/scriptlets.d/ <--- contains "scriptlets" (or plugins)
  and the various scriptlets that live here
/etc/hibernate/scriptlets.d/     <--- contains any extra scriptlets
/usr/local/man/man8/hibernate.8
/usr/local/man/man5/hibernate.conf.5

If you already have a configuration file at /etc/hibernate/hibernate.conf, the
new configuation file will be installed at /etc/hibernate/hibernate.conf.dist
You will have to merge your changes manually.

CONFIGURATION
-------------

The default configuration does nothing but save and restore your clock, and
unload some modules that will potentially cause suspending to fail. If you have
other kernel modules that need to be unloaded, filesystems unmounted, network
interfaces brought down, etc, you will want to customise the configuration file
in /etc/hibernate/hibernate.conf. Run hibernate -h for help on the possible
options. There is also a man page for hibernate.conf as well as hibernate
itself.

RUNNING
-------
Simply calling "hibernate" as root will do everything mentioned in the
configuration file to hibernate, and activate Software Suspend. Upon resuming,
any tasks for resuming the machine are run and the script exits.

If you want users other than root to be able to run the script, check out the
sudo package.

You may wish to call this script from acpid to allow you to press a button on
your machine to hibernate.

HELP
----
If you have problems with the hibernate script or Software Suspend, the best
place to ask is on the mailing list - softwaresuspend-help@lists.berlios.de.
You will need to subscribe to post. See
http://softwaresuspend.berlios.de/lists.html for details.

If the suspend process itself crashes (while "Writing caches", "Reading
caches", or "Copying original kernel back", etc), then the problem lies with
Software Suspend 2 itself. See the FAQ at http://softwaresuspend.berlios.de/ for
help on debugging.
